# BBSPointEvent
Hello to anyone downloading this.  

*********NOTE*********** This has to be in 1280*720 or the program will not work. 

This is a macro from AutoHotKey for BBS Point Event.  Really straightforward, just use the AHK Key and make sure you have enough soul tickets.  
The exit key (to stop the program) is ESC.  

Tips:
-Move the AHK to a desktop etc to make sure it is easy to click the AHK file etc... (It isn't Needed but would be nice)
-I used mostly continue break paragraphs because for some odd reason using the simple chain command wasn't working.  Either way it works now.
